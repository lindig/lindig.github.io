## Warm-Up

* Rowing off in rolling 4s, square blades, from 1/2 slide, lengthening
  out to 3/4 slide, full slide

* Once at full slide, focus on sequence: recovery lead by the hand:
  weight shift to the front of the seat by rocking up and over. The hand
  moves out - this gives us time on slide (which is counter intuitive).

* From Green Dragon in 6s, later feathered

* From Railway in 8s

* Pause at the finish, hands off the handle (hovering), every other
  stroke. The boat is set with the body, we tap down together.

* Pause at bodies over: we arrive here having rocked together. From now
  we are still on slide into the front.

* Pause at 1/2 slide.

* Steady state to the lock; short burst rate 24 on 1st Post Reach. It's
  more about the confidence to reach that rate than keeping it going for
  long. Maybe repeat.

## Standing Start

We want to build on the exercise we did over the lock: moving the boat.
Start sequence: 3+5+10,; the 3 are 3/4, 1/2, 3/4. "come forward" -
blades still flat on the water, we want to stay relaxed; 3/4 is with
handle over the center line of the boat; explicit: "square" - we want
the blade solidly anchored.

Going trough this:

- 1 stroke to move the boat, not ripping, finishing together, finishing
  the stroke. We can't finish together if a seat rips through the water
  and arrives early at the finish. Some coxes call this "com-plete"
  instead of "draw 1".

- 3 strokes, finish at hands away. Don't worry about the rate - finish
  the stroke - the rate comes up naturally with the shortened stroke.

- 3+5 strokes. We wind over the 5 strokes. The stroke is front loaded,
  initially short at the finish - no back swing - all is coming from the
  legs. This moves the boat but is not sustainable. This ends with
  "backs in" or "hips in" - we gradually lengthen the stroke now by using more hip swing. The boat has reached race pace.

- 3+5+10. Over the 10 strokes we lengthen the stroke - moving from a
  front loaded stroke to out regular stroke that has more send,
  maintaining speed, now want to move with more efficiency.

- "Rhythm": one strong leg push; moving to a sustainable rate.

- Winding down.

## Rate Work

We don't want to use this to prove that we can cover long distance at
high rate. We want to bring efficiency from lower rate to higher rate -
ideally doing the same thing just more often. We accept that the stroke
slightly shortens; and we don't need to pull as hard per stroke - above
rate 24 the individual stroke is not harder but maybe lighter.

* Rate ladder or pyramid; rate 24, 28, 30, 32 each for 1:00 or 1:30
  duration with 0:30 to 1:00 steady state in-between; proper winds in a
  rolling start for each.
